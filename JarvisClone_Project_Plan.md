# JarvisClone AI Assistant Project Plan




## 1. Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for developing "JarvisClone," a fully functional, cross-platform AI assistant application. The project aims to deliver an intelligent conversational agent capable of understanding natural language, retrieving real-time information, and integrating with various functionalities through a flexible plugin architecture. JarvisClone will support multiple languages, including Bengali, English, and Hindi, and offer extensible user interfaces such as a Command Line Interface (CLI), a web dashboard, and a CLI-to-voice fallback.

The core of JarvisClone will leverage Python 3.8+ and utilize the `google/gemma-3n-e4b-it:free` model from OpenRouter.ai for its large language model (LLM) capabilities. Web search integration will be achieved using the DuckDuckGo JSON API, ensuring real-time information retrieval without reliance on third-party SDKs. For voice synthesis, the `puter.ai` text-to-speech service will be employed. Persistent memory will be managed through a local JSON-based vector store, such as Chroma or a plain file system.

The deployment strategy focuses on containerization using Docker, enabling cross-platform compatibility and simplified deployment on Linux servers. A robust Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline will be established using GitHub Actions, with unit tests implemented via `pytest` to ensure code quality and reliability. The project is structured with a clear timeline, targeting a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within two weeks and a production-ready application within six weeks, all while adhering to a budget that prioritizes open-source tools and avoids paid subscriptions.

This plan details the project's phases, milestones, architectural design, core code samples, and a thorough risk assessment with mitigation strategies. It also provides justifications for technology choices, explores alternative deployment options, and includes an example CI/CD workflow to guide the development process.




## 2. Architecture

The architecture of JarvisClone is designed to be modular, scalable, and extensible, allowing for easy integration of new features and interfaces. The core component, the AI Assistant Core, acts as the central processing unit, handling conversational logic, LLM interactions, and memory management. This core interacts with various external services for specialized functionalities such as web search and text-to-speech.

**Explanation of Components:**

*   **User CLI (Command Line Interface):** Provides a text-based interface for user interaction, suitable for quick commands and scripting. This will be the primary interface for initial development and testing.
*   **Web Dashboard:** A web-based graphical user interface (GUI) offering a richer and more intuitive user experience. This will be built using either React or Flask, providing flexibility for future enhancements.
*   **AI Assistant Core:** The brain of JarvisClone. It orchestrates the entire process, from receiving user input to generating responses. Key responsibilities include:
    *   **Conversational Chat Loop:** Manages the flow of conversation, maintaining context and history.
    *   **LLM Interaction:** Communicates with the OpenRouter.ai `google/gemma-3n-e4b-it:free` model for natural language understanding and generation.
    *   **Memory Management:** Stores and retrieves conversational history and user preferences, utilizing a local JSON-based vector store.
    *   **Plugin Management:** Provides an interface for integrating new functionalities like calendar, email, and reminders.
*   **Memory Store:** A persistent storage mechanism for conversational context and user-specific data. This will be implemented using a local JSON-based vector store (e.g., Chroma or a plain file system) to meet the open-source and no-paid-subscription constraints.
*   **Search API:** Integrates with the DuckDuckGo JSON API to provide real-time information retrieval. This allows JarvisClone to answer questions requiring up-to-date information from the web.
*   **TTS (Text-to-Speech):** Utilizes the `puter.ai` service to convert textual responses from the AI Assistant Core into spoken language, enabling voice-based interactions.

### 2.2. Technology Stack Justification

*   **Python 3.8+:** Chosen as the primary development language due to its extensive libraries for AI/ML, natural language processing, and web development. Its readability and large community support make it ideal for rapid prototyping and long-term maintenance.
*   **OpenRouter.ai (`google/gemma-3n-e4b-it:free`):** Selected for its accessibility as a free LLM model, aligning with the project's budget constraints. OpenRouter.ai provides a unified API for various models, simplifying integration and offering flexibility for future model changes if needed.
*   **DuckDuckGo JSON API:** A privacy-focused search engine with a straightforward JSON API, making it easy to integrate for web search capabilities without requiring complex SDKs or authentication, thus adhering to the open-source and no-paid-subscription constraints.
*   **`puter.ai` (txt2speech):** A simple and free text-to-speech service that meets the requirement for voice synthesis without additional authentication. Its ease of use allows for quick implementation of voice capabilities.
*   **Local JSON-based Vector Store (e.g., Chroma or plain file):** This choice directly addresses the constraint of using open-source tools and avoiding paid subscriptions for persistent memory. While not as performant as dedicated database solutions, it is sufficient for an MVP and can be scaled or replaced later if performance becomes a bottleneck. Chroma is a good candidate for a local vector store due to its Python-native implementation and ease of use.
*   **Docker:** Essential for containerization, ensuring that JarvisClone can be deployed consistently across different Linux environments. Docker simplifies dependency management and creates isolated environments, reducing 


the "it works on my machine" problem.
*   **GitHub Actions:** A powerful CI/CD tool integrated directly into GitHub, making it easy to automate testing and deployment workflows. It aligns with the open-source constraint and is widely used in the developer community.
*   **`pytest`:** A popular and powerful testing framework for Python. Its simple syntax and rich feature set make it ideal for writing unit tests for the core functionalities of JarvisClone, ensuring code quality and reliability.

    """Simple JSON-based memory store for conversation history and context."""
    
    def __init__(self, memory_file: str = "memory.json"):
        self.memory_file = memory_file
        self.memory = self._load_memory()
    
    def add_conversation(self, user_input: str, assistant_response: str):
        """Add a conversation turn to memory."""
        conversation_entry = {
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "user": user_input,
            "assistant": assistant_response
        }
        self.memory["conversations"].append(conversation_entry)
        
        # Keep only last 50 conversations to prevent memory bloat
        if len(self.memory["conversations"]) > 50:
            self.memory["conversations"] = self.memory["conversations"][-50:]
        
        self._save_memory()

class LLMClient:
    """Client for interacting with OpenRouter.ai LLM."""
    
    def generate_response(self, messages: List[Dict[str, str]], 
                         temperature: float = 0.7, 
                         max_tokens: int = 1000) -> Optional[str]:
        """Generate a response using the LLM."""
        payload = {
            "model": self.model,
            "messages": messages,
            "temperature": temperature,
            "max_tokens": max_tokens
        }
        
        try:
            response = requests.post(
                self.base_url,
                headers=self.headers,
                json=payload,
                timeout=30
            )
            response.raise_for_status()
            
            data = response.json()
            return data["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
            
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            logger.error(f"LLM API request failed: {e}")
            return None

class JarvisCore:
    """Main AI assistant core class."""
    
    def process_input(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        """Process user input and generate a response."""
        # Check if user is asking for web search
        if self.searcher and any(keyword in user_input.lower() for keyword in 
                                ["search", "latest", "current", "news", "what's happening"]):
            search_results = self.searcher.search(user_input)
            if search_results:
                enhanced_input = f"{user_input}\n\nWeb search results:\n{search_results}"
            else:
                enhanced_input = user_input
        else:
            enhanced_input = user_input
        
        # Build messages with context
        messages = self._build_messages(enhanced_input)
        
        # Generate response using LLM
        response = self.llm.generate_response(messages)
        
        if response:
            # Store conversation in memory
            self.memory.add_conversation(user_input, response)
            return response
        else:
            fallback_response = "I apologize, but I'm having trouble processing your request right now. Please try again."
            self.memory.add_conversation(user_input, fallback_response)
            return fallback_response
```

### 4.2. Web Search Integration (assistant/search.py)

The search module provides real-time information retrieval capabilities using the DuckDuckGo JSON API. This implementation handles various types of search results including instant answers, definitions, and related topics.

```python
import requests
import json
import logging
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
from urllib.parse import quote_plus

class WebSearcher:
    """Web search client using DuckDuckGo JSON API."""
    
    def search(self, query: str, max_results: int = 5) -> Optional[str]:
        """Search the web using DuckDuckGo API."""
        try:
            params = {
                'q': query,
                'format': 'json',
                'no_html': '1',
                'skip_disambig': '1'
            }
            
            response = self.session.get(self.base_url, params=params, timeout=10)
            response.raise_for_status()
            
            data = response.json()
            results = self._format_results(data, max_results)
            
            if results:
                return results
            else:
                return self._web_search_fallback(query, max_results)
                
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            logger.error(f"Search request failed: {e}")
            return None
    
    def _format_results(self, data: Dict[str, Any], max_results: int) -> Optional[str]:
        """Format DuckDuckGo API response into readable text."""
        results = []
        
        # Check for instant answer
        if data.get('Answer'):
            results.append(f"Answer: {data['Answer']}")
        
        # Check for abstract
        if data.get('Abstract'):
            results.append(f"Summary: {data['Abstract']}")
            if data.get('AbstractURL'):
                results.append(f"Source: {data['AbstractURL']}")
        
        # Check for related topics
        if data.get('RelatedTopics'):
            topics = data['RelatedTopics'][:max_results]
            if topics:
                results.append("Related Information:")
                for topic in topics:
                    if isinstance(topic, dict) and topic.get('Text'):
                        results.append(f"- {topic['Text']}")
                        if topic.get('FirstURL'):
                            results.append(f"  Source: {topic['FirstURL']}")
        
        return "\n".join(results) if results else None
```

### 4.3. Text-to-Speech Integration (assistant/voice.py)

The voice module enables JarvisClone to speak responses aloud using the puter.ai text-to-speech service. This implementation includes audio playback capabilities and fallback mechanisms for different operating systems.

```python
import requests
import tempfile
import subprocess
from typing import Optional

class TTSClient:
    """Text-to-Speech client using puter.ai service."""
    
    def speak(self, text: str, voice: str = "en-US-Standard-A", speed: float = 1.0) -> bool:
        """Convert text to speech and play it."""
        try:
            audio_data = self._generate_speech(text, voice, speed)
            
            if audio_data:
                return self._play_audio(audio_data)
            else:
                logger.error("Failed to generate speech audio")
                return False
                
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"TTS error: {e}")
            return False
    
    def _generate_speech(self, text: str, voice: str, speed: float) -> Optional[bytes]:
        """Generate speech audio from text using puter.ai API."""
        try:
            payload = {
                "text": text,
                "voice": voice,
                "speed": speed,
                "format": "mp3"
            }
            
            response = self.session.post(
                self.base_url,
                json=payload,
                timeout=30
            )
            
            if response.status_code == 200:
                content_type = response.headers.get('content-type', '')
                
                if 'application/json' in content_type:
                    try:
                        json_response = response.json()
                        if 'audio_url' in json_response:
                            audio_response = self.session.get(json_response['audio_url'])
                            if audio_response.status_code == 200:
                                return audio_response.content
                    except json.JSONDecodeError:
                        return None
                else:
                    return response.content
            
            return None
                
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            logger.error(f"TTS API request failed: {e}")
            return None
```

### 4.4. Web Dashboard Interface

### 4.5. Flask Web Application Backend

The Flask backend serves the web dashboard and provides API endpoints for chat and text-to-speech functionality. It integrates seamlessly with the JarvisCore to process user requests.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, send_from_directory
from flask_cors import CORS
from assistant.core import JarvisCore

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

# Initialize JarvisCore
jarvis = JarvisCore()

@app.route('/api/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        if not data or 'message' not in data:
            return jsonify({'error': 'Message is required'}), 400
        
        user_message = data['message']
        response = jarvis.process_input(user_message)
        
        return jsonify({
            'response': response,
            'status': 'success'
        })
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({
            'error': str(e),
            'status': 'error'
        }), 500

@app.route('/api/speak', methods=['POST'])
def speak():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        if not data or 'text' not in data:
            return jsonify({'error': 'Text is required'}), 400
        
        text = data['text']
        success = jarvis.speak_response(text)
        
        return jsonify({
            'success': success,
            'status': 'success' if success else 'error'
        })
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({
            'error': str(e),
            'status': 'error'
        }), 500
